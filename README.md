# Square
## Overview and Origin 
Square was founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey on Feb 14, 2009. Similar to Google with Alphabet, Square created a parent company called Block inc in December 2021. Square is now one of five subsidiary of Block (NYSE SQ). The others are Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL and TBD.  

Square is a platform for small business to accept credit card payments. The idea for Square was came from founder Jim McKelvey. McKelvey was a glass blower who had recived a large order over the phone, however the order fell through because he could not accept credit cards.  McKelvey reached out to Jack Dorsey, then CEO of Twitter and friend, to help him come up with a solution to the problem.  

Square started with multiple rounds of VC funding. The company’s series E round in had valued them at $6B pre-money. In 2015 Square went public in with an $2.9B valuation. Block currently has a ~32B market cap. 

## Business Activities
Small business previously faced significant fees in order to accept credit card payments. Square’s initial solutions allowed small business owners to leverage smartphones to accept credit card payments in person. Square has expanded its service to integrate its payments processing service into an ecosystem of tools and services that help business with processing payroll, calculating costs and tracking customers. The overall ecosystem provides sellers the data and support to help grow their business. Square’s ecosystem and its ability to integrate with other popular tools gives it an advantage over other similar companies. The total addressable market was estimated by Square to be ~$100B

## Landscape
Square is in the payments processing space. However with the expansion of the their ecosystem they are trending into a general financial services provider. 
The payment processing industry has benefited from 2 technologies  

**The smartphone/mobile devices**
Here square leveraged growing popularity of smartphones by creating an app with a low cost card reader to replace a large, usually expensive, credit card reader.  

**Highspeed cellular data connections**
Without the cellphones cellular data connection the ablity of a usre to take a payment would have been significaly impacted. Cellualr data allowed users to have an internet connection anywhere they had service, freeing them from the cofines of private network— a critical feature used by many small business.  

**Competitors to Square are:**

## Results
Since it’s creation square has quickly grown into one of the largest payment processeor. The market size is usually measured by Gross Payment Volume. Square has done $52.5B in GVP last quarter. This has given it between 19% and 27% market share in Retail and Food industries respectively. While their have a large share of the market the company has generated a loss over its last 3 quarters, with a $209M loss in its last quarter ending June 30th.  


## Recommendations

I recommend square looks to expaned by buying Clear Secure, the biometric verification company. The combination could allow the creation of biometric based payment system that could free uses from the need to carry credit cards for inperson transaction.
Currently Clear’s biometic servies are used at airports around the country to verify travlers and at major events, baseball games and concerts,  to speed up entry of clear’s subscribers. Leveraging Clear’s biometric technology and Square’s payment processing. A user could buy a product with their thumb print or retinal scan. This would be similar to Apple pay’s system however it would not require the user carry anything. 
This would benefit square by expanding their product offering providing them a completely differentiated experience from other payment processers.
