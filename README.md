# Square
## Overview and Origin 
Square was founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey on Feb 14, 2009. Similar to Google with Alphabet, Square created a parent company called Block inc in December 2021. Square is now one of five subsidiaries of Block (NYSE SQ). The others are Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL, and TBD.  

Square is a platform for small businesses to accept credit card payments. The idea for Square came from founder Jim McKelvey. McKelvey was a glass blower who had received a large order over the phone; however, the order fell through because he could not accept credit cards. McKelvey reached out to Jack Dorsey, then CEO of Twitter and friend, to help him come up with a solution to the problem.  

Square started with multiple rounds of VC funding. The company’s series E round had valued them at $6B pre-money. In 2015 Square went public in with a $2.9B valuation. Block currently has a ~32B market cap. 

## Business Activities
Small businesses previously faced significant fees to accept credit card payments. Square’s initial solutions allowed small business owners to leverage smartphones to accept credit card payments in person. Square has expanded its service to integrate its payments processing service into an ecosystem of tools and services that help businesses process payroll, calculate costs, and track customers. The overall ecosystem provides sellers with the data and support to help grow their businesses. Square’s ecosystem and integration with other popular tools give it an advantage over similar companies. Square estimated the total addressable market to be ~$100B   

The technologies used are:
-	Various programming languages such as Javascript, Java, Ruby, Objective-c
-	Hadoop
-	Vertica
-	Kafka
-	Airflow
-	Git  


## Landscape
Square is in the payments processing space. However, with the expansion of their ecosystem, they are trending into a general financial services provider. 
The payment processing industry has benefited from 2 technologies.  

**The smartphone/mobile devices**
Here Square leveraged the growing popularity of smartphones by creating an app with a low-cost card reader to replace a large, usually expensive, credit card reader.  

**Highspeed cellular data connections**
Without the cellphone cellular data connection, users would have difficulty taking a payment remotely. Cellular data allowed users to have an internet connection anywhere they had service, freeing them from the confines of the private network— a critical feature used by many small businesses.  

**Competitors to Square are:**
- NCR
- Toast
- Clover
- First Data


## Results
Since its creation, Square has quickly grown into one of the largest payment processors. The market size is usually measured by Gross Payment Volume. Square has done $52.5B in GVP last quarter. This has given it between 19% and 27% market share in the Retail and Food industries, respectively. While they have a large percentage of the market, the company has generated a loss over its last three quarters, with a $209M loss in its previous quarter ending Jun 30.  


## Recommendations

I recommend Square expand by buying Clear Secure, the biometric verification company. The combination could create a biometric-based payment system that could free users from the need to carry credit cards for in-person transactions.
### Leveraging Clear’s biometric technology and Square’s payment processing.
Currently, Clear’s biometric services are used at airports around the country to verify travelers and at major events, baseball games, and concerts,  to speed up the entry of clear’s subscribers. A user could buy a product with their thumbprint or retinal scan. This would be similar to Apple pay’s system; however, it would not require the user to carry anything. 
This would benefit Square by expanding its product offering, providing them a completely differentiated experience from other payment processors.
